-- Fix Email Confirmation Issue for Supabase Authentication
-- This script provides solutions for handling email confirmation

-- =====================================================
-- SOLUTION 1: DISABLE EMAIL CONFIRMATION (DEVELOPMENT ONLY)
-- =====================================================

-- WARNING: Only use this for development/testing environments
-- For production, you should keep email confirmation enabled

-- This setting can only be changed through the Supabase Dashboard:
-- 1. Go to Authentication → Settings
-- 2. Find "Enable email confirmations" 
-- 3. Toggle it OFF for development
-- 4. Save changes

SELECT 'EMAIL CONFIRMATION SETTINGS' as info;
SELECT 'Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings → Disable "Enable email confirmations"' as instruction_1;

-- =====================================================
-- SOLUTION 2: HANDLE EMAIL CONFIRMATION PROPERLY (RECOMMENDED)
-- =====================================================

-- Check current auth configuration
SELECT 'CHECKING AUTH CONFIGURATION...' as status;

-- You can verify email confirmation status programmatically
SELECT 'Current email confirmation setting can only be viewed in Supabase Dashboard' as info;

-- SOLUTION 3: AUTO-CONFIRM EMAILS (DEVELOPMENT HELPER)

-- DO NOT use this in production

-- If you need to manually confirm existing unconfirmed users:
-- Note: This requires service role key and should be done carefully
