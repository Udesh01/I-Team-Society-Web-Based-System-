# CRITICAL: Database Error Resolution Guide

## Current Error Analysis

- **Error**: `POST https://xywggqgljyoicqqhrlst.supabase.co/auth/v1/signup 500 (Internal Server Error)`
- **Root Cause**: Database-level issues preventing user creation during signup
- **Impact**: Staff registration completely blocked

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Login to your account
3. Select your project: `xywggqgljyoicqqhrlst`

### Step 2: Open SQL Editor

1. In the left sidebar, click **"SQL Editor"**
2. Click **"New Query"** button

### Step 3: Run Emergency Fix

1. **COPY** the entire content from `EMERGENCY_DATABASE_FIX.sql`
2. **PASTE** it into the SQL Editor
3. **CLICK** the "Run" button (or press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter)

### Step 4: Wait for Completion

- You should see multiple status messages like:
  - "EMERGENCY DATABASE FIX STARTING..."
  - "DROPPING ALL EXISTING POLICIES..."
  - "GRANTING NECESSARY PERMISSIONS..."
  - "ðŸŽ‰ EMERGENCY DATABASE FIX COMPLETED!"

### Step 5: Verify Success

- Look for the final message: "Try registering a new user now - it should work!"
- If you see any ERROR messages, copy them and share them

## Alternative Quick Fix (If SQL Editor Doesn't Work)

### Option A: Disable RLS Temporarily

Run this minimal script in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Temporarily disable RLS to allow registration
ALTER TABLE profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE student_details DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE staff_details DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE memberships DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Grant all permissions
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO anon;

SELECT 'Quick fix applied - try registration now' as status;
```

### Option B: Check Authentication Settings

1. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Settings** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Ensure "Enable email confirmations" is **DISABLED** for development
3. Check that "Site URL" is set to `http://localhost:5173`

## After Running the Fix

### Test Registration

1. Go back to your app: http://localhost:5173
2. Navigate to staff registration
3. Fill out the form and submit
4. Registration should work without the 500 error

### If Still Having Issues

- Check the browser Network tab for the exact error response
- Look at the Supabase Dashboard â†’ Logs for detailed error messages
- Share any new error messages you see

## Why This Fix Works

The emergency fix addresses the core issues that cause "Database error saving new user":

1. **Removes conflicting RLS policies** that block database writes
2. **Grants proper permissions** to authenticated and anonymous users
3. **Recreates user creation triggers** that may be broken
4. **Uses simple ownership-based policies** to avoid recursion

## Success Indicators

âœ… Staff registration form submits without 500 error
âœ… User appears in Supabase Auth â†’ Users
âœ… Profile data is created in profiles table
âœ… Staff details are saved correctly
âœ… Login works after registration
