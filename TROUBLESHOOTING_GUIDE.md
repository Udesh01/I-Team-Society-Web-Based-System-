## üîß Immediate Fixes

### Step 1: Fix Database Issues (CRITICAL)

**Run the Emergency SQL Script** in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to "SQL Editor"
3. Copy and paste the contents of `database/emergency-fix.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Create missing storage buckets
- ‚úÖ Fix RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- ‚úÖ Prevent duplicate membership operations
- ‚úÖ Add missing database columns
- ‚úÖ Create proper indexes for performance

### Step 2: Verify Your Environment Variables

Check your `.env.local` file contains:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

**To find these values:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API
2. Copy the "Project URL" and "anon public key"

### Step 3: Test Authentication

1. Try logging out and logging back in
2. Check if you can access your profile page
3. Verify your user role is set correctly in the database

## üîç Detailed Error Analysis & Solutions

### Error 1: Profile Photo Upload (StorageService Error)

**Root Cause:** Missing storage bucket or incorrect RLS policies

- Simplified permission checks to avoid complex folder-based restrictions

**Test Fix:**
1. Go to Profile page
2. Click "Edit Profile"
3. Try uploading a new profile photo
4. Should now work without permission errors

### Error 2: Event List 400 Error

- Added proper RLS policies for events table

**Test Fix:**

- Cleaned up existing duplicate records

**Test Fix:**
1. Go to Admin ‚Üí Membership Management
2. Try approving a membership

## üö® If Errors Persist

### Check These Common Issues:

1. **RLS Policies Not Applied:**

   SELECT tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';
   ```

2. **Missing Tables/Columns:**
   ```sql
   -- Check table structure
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
   ```

3. **Storage Bucket Missing:**
   ```sql
   -- Check storage buckets
   SELECT id, name, public FROM storage.buckets;
   ```

### Debug Steps:

1. **Open Browser Developer Tools (F12)**
2. **Check Console tab for JavaScript errors**
3. **Check Network tab for failed requests**
4. **Look for specific error codes:**
   - 400: Bad request (usually query/permission issues)
   - 403: Forbidden (RLS policy blocks access)
   - 409: Conflict (duplicate operations)

If issues persist after following this guide:

1. **Check the verification queries** at the end of `emergency-fix.sql`
