-- =====================================================
-- NEXT STEPS BASED ON RESULTS
-- =====================================================

/*
BASED ON THE RESULTS ABOVE:

‚ùå NOT AUTHENTICATED:
   - User needs to log in to the dashboard
   - Check if login is working properly

‚ùå TABLES MISSING:
   - Run database setup scripts
   - Create missing tables

üîí RLS ENABLED + NO DATA ACCESS:
   - RLS policies are blocking access
   - Run minimal-dashboard-fix.sql to temporarily disable RLS
   - Or create proper RLS policies

‚ùå NO USER PROFILE/MEMBERSHIP:
   - User account might not be properly set up
   - Check user registration process

‚ùå STORAGE BUCKETS MISSING:
   - Profile photo upload won't work
   - Create storage buckets

‚úÖ EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD:
   - Issue might be in the frontend code
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Use the debug tool in the dashboard
